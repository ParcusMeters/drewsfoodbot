## Menu Review Feature
- Use the `messenger_reactions` webhook to create an input into a database.
    - A thumbs up will be a positive review, while a thumbs down will be negative.
    - This will trigger an insert into a MySQL database, which will join the review onto the menu (so you know which menu the review is for).
- The database will be hosted on AWS RDS, using MySQL.
    - This data could be retrieved manually or sent automatically (needs further research).
- A website could be created that links with the bot.
    - This will display the data from the reviews.
- An info stripper/scanner can be used to further expand reviews.
    - This data could separate whether people like particular menu items using regression.

## PCL Feature
- A quick response option that displays the information of the PCLs.
- It will allow the PCLs to be contacted easily.
- The PCLs will be displayed with an image and a description of them.

## Calendar Feature
